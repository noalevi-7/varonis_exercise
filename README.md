# Google Drive Monitor - Varonis exercise

Simple Python command-line application that makes requests to the Drive V2 / V3 API,
so you can monitor onca a day for new files creation and manage their permissions.



## Prerequisites
- Python
- Activate the Drive API in the Google API Console([the detail page](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project/))
- Enable `Drive API` and `Drive Activity API`
- Create a OAuth client ID credential and download the json file ([the detail page](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials/))
- Rename the json file to - credentials.json

## Install 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
```
python drive_monitor.py
```
- This program run once a day by scheduler engine, and checks for file creation that happened the day before.
- For every file creation the program checks its permissions, if this file has `anyone` access, the program remove this permit.
- The program print out the sharing status for each file it checks.
### output examples 
```
File creation summary for the past day

readme - sharing status:
    - Has user access for user id 07010884606913906718, with owner role

fmd - sharing status:
    - Has user access for user id 07010884606913906718, with owner role

shared_with_uri - sharing status:
    - Has user access for user id 10758064074363540534, with writer role
    - Has user access for user id 07010884606913906718, with owner role
```

```
File creation summary for the past day

new_file_public - sharing status:
    - Had Public access, removed by the program
    - Has user access for user id 07010884606913906718, with owner role

readme - sharing status:
    - Had Public access, removed by the program
    - Has user access for user id 07010884606913906718, with owner role

fmd - sharing status:
    - Had Public access, removed by the program
    - Has user access for user id 07010884606913906718, with owner role
```

## Notes
- On your first run, you will be prompted to log in. If you are logged into multiple Google accounts, you will be asked to select one account to use for the authorization.
- I've tried to translate the `user_id` into `user_name` without success. I've notice the option to get `user_id` by giving the `email`, so it will be possible to ask for all company emails in order to be able to translate them into `user id`, and therefore the log will be more readable.
- I've tried to retrive the default sharing settings without success. For non-company account the default sharing settings is `Restricted`, but I did not find the relevant documentation in order to request this info.
This settings can be change if you are a GSuit administrator for your company, you can change it to `anyone at my organization`. If I have an account that can change this settings I would do it from the web app and look on the `F12 Network Window` to see the relevent request, and add this to my program.
